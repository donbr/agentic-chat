assumptions:
  - Audience: hands-on AI engineers familiar with Python, containers, and basic LLM APIs.
  - Scope emphasizes GitHub code (Parts 2–4 are repo-first), with notebooks referenced only if needed.
  - Platform-agnostic; examples reference OpenAI, but concepts generalize.

non_goals:
  - Full re-implementation of the projects.
  - Shipping cloud infra manifests beyond sketches (Terraform/K8s).
  - Handling secrets beyond local/dev guidance.

guardrails:
  - Cite every non-obvious claim to the series videos or specific repo files/lines.
  - Prefer minimal, runnable code fragments; avoid long monoliths.
  - Flag gaps explicitly; do not fabricate paths/APIs.

tasks:
  - id: build-chatgpt-study-guide
    name: "Study Guide Research"
    role: "Expert AI curriculum designer"
    objective: >
      Create a concise, step-by-step study guide covering:
      (1) Prompting & Responses API, (2) RAG & Connectors,
      (3) Agentic Search & Agents SDK, and (4) Vibe-Coding & Deployment.
