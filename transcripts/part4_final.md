# Part 4: Vibe-Coding & Deployment ## [00:00:03 - 00:00:36] Welcome to AI Maker Space, the world's leading community for people like you leading community for people like you who want to build, ship, and share who want to build, ship, and share production LLM applications. Whiz, are production LLM applications. Whiz, are we ready to go today? we ready to go today? &gt;&gt; Well, I've built and shipped my code. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. That means it's time to &gt;&gt; Oh my god. That means it's time to &gt;&gt; share. &gt;&gt; share. Building, shipping, and sharing is at Building, shipping, and sharing is at the core of everything that you need to the core of everything that you need to do to succeed in the 21st century. You do to succeed in the 21st century. You want to get on the path? Join the want to get on the path? Join the Discord today and we'll see you on the ## [00:00:36 - 00:01:08] Discord today and we'll see you on the other side. The event starts in three, other side. The event starts in three, two, and one. two, and one. How to build ChatGPT. We're bringing How to build ChatGPT. We're bringing the vividity vibes today, Whiz. I feel the vividity vibes today, Whiz. I feel like you've got some serious vibes in like you've got some serious vibes in store. Am I right? store. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got vibes for days. &gt;&gt; So, there's a lot of talk about vibe &gt;&gt; So, there's a lot of talk about vibe coding these days. And it's not quite coding these days. And it's not quite the same as what you need to do in your the same as what you need to do in your day job as an AI engineer, though. Is ## [00:01:08 - 00:01:40] day job as an AI engineer, though. Is it? it? &gt;&gt; No. No. Not quite the same at all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, so this idea of AI &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so this idea of AI assist, we're going to go deep into it assist, we're going to go deep into it today. And this idea of leveraging the today. And this idea of leveraging the right amount of AI assist to help you right amount of AI assist to help you build ship and share production LM build ship and share production LM applications like ChatGPT style ones. applications like ChatGPT style ones. This is a really important topic and we This is a really important topic and we can actually see and feel the difference can actually see and feel the difference in your demos today. But there's also a in your demos today. But there's also a lot of nuance between vibing yourself ## [00:01:40 - 00:02:13] lot of nuance between vibing yourself into a rabbit hole and developing into a rabbit hole and developing software like a professional. And you software like a professional. And you know what what's the TLDDR on all of know what what's the TLDDR on all of this was? this was? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean vibe coding is dope. Uh love that. Uh but it's not really uh love that. Uh but it's not really uh that interesting beyond that it's it's that interesting beyond that it's it's kind of dope. Uh, kind of dope. Uh, &gt;&gt; so you're going to find that you hit a &gt;&gt; so you're going to find that you hit a wall real early with uh with vibe coding wall real early with uh with vibe coding uh in a way that's uh undesirable. ## [00:02:13 - 00:02:46] uh in a way that's uh undesirable. &gt;&gt; And we can use it though as we'll see to &gt;&gt; And we can use it though as we'll see to build ChatGPT. build ChatGPT. &gt;&gt; Oh, that it can do. Yeah. even incorporating all the stuff we've even incorporating all the stuff we've built already in this series like the built already in this series like the ability to leverage the Responses API, ability to leverage the Responses API, the ability to do RAG, maybe add a the ability to do RAG, maybe add a couple connectors, all of this. It can couple connectors, all of this. It can actually do this through some vibes. Uh yes, it can uh heavily through vibes. It ## [00:02:46 - 00:03:17] yes, it can uh heavily through vibes. It you can get there you can get there you can get there you can get there actually a number of different ways actually a number of different ways which is pretty cool. So uh there there which is pretty cool. So uh there there you go. you go. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm excited to see exactly how &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm excited to see exactly how this all works out. We're going to talk this all works out. We're going to talk through today vibe coding versus AI through today vibe coding versus AI assist. Building, shipping, and sharing assist. Building, shipping, and sharing ChatGPT in a variety of ways. You ready ChatGPT in a variety of ways. You ready to kick off? to kick off? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's do it. All right, everybody. Welcome to how to build ChatGPT. This is part four, is part four, vibe coding and deployment. We're going ## [00:03:17 - 00:03:49] vibe coding and deployment. We're going to talk a little bit about each of these to talk a little bit about each of these pieces today as we align ourselves to pieces today as we align ourselves to the session. If you spend the next hour the session. If you spend the next hour with us, it's going to be a lot clearer with us, it's going to be a lot clearer to you where those fine lines are to you where those fine lines are between vibe coding and AI assisted between vibe coding and AI assisted development. development. This is becoming more and more This is becoming more and more important, especially if you want a important, especially if you want a professional position on a a true AI professional position on a a true AI engineering team doing stuff in engineering team doing stuff in production. And then we also want to see ## [00:03:49 - 00:04:20] production. And then we also want to see exactly how we can build and deploy a exactly how we can build and deploy a ChatGPT style application. Whether ChatGPT style application. Whether we're using something that feels very we're using something that feels very very low code or something that is a very low code or something that is a little more aligned with most of the little more aligned with most of the stuff we do on this channel which is stuff we do on this channel which is down in the weeds. the tooling is down in the weeds. the tooling is always changing and we're going to give always changing and we're going to give you a state-of-the-art peek at the best you a state-of-the-art peek at the best tooling for the job today using a number tooling for the job today using a number of different kind of slightly more AI ## [00:04:20 - 00:04:54] of different kind of slightly more AI assisted techniques. And so we'll we'll assisted techniques. And so we'll we'll we'll vibe code and we'll deploy an AI we'll vibe code and we'll deploy an AI app. We're going to use Verscell. We app. We will also opt for a fast API backend on will also opt for a fast API backend on our our our particular build. uh but you'll see particular build. uh but you'll see exactly how all of this can work with a exactly how all of this can work with a number of different tool stacks. So number of different tool stacks. So let's introduce vibe coding properly let's introduce vibe coding properly first before we talk about how it is in first before we talk about how it is in fact becoming a thing and ## [00:04:54 - 00:05:28] fact becoming a thing and then we'll talk a little bit about how then we'll talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about our end to we should be thinking about our end to end front and back application stack end front and back application stack before before before we see whizzes pretty awesome demo we see whizzes pretty awesome demo today. Please ask questions along the today. If you have questions at any time, way. If you have questions at any time, throw them directly into the YouTube throw them directly into the YouTube live chat or directly into the comments live chat or directly into the comments on your viewing platform. First of all, on your viewing platform. First of all, vibe coding. We really can vibe coding. We really can source this idea. We can see who brought ## [00:05:28 - 00:06:01] source this idea. We can see who brought this to kind of the four of our public this to kind of the four of our public consciousness. The OG Andre Karpathy consciousness. The OG Andre Karpathy himself himself himself kind of dropped this banger in February, kind of dropped this banger in February, vibe coding, where you fully give into vibe coding, where you fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget the code even exists. I'm building a project or a web app, but it's not really coding. it's not really coding. ## [00:06:01 - 00:06:32] It's not really coding. I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it it mostly and copy paste stuff, and it it mostly works. Now, this works. Now, this was popularized shortly thereafter was popularized shortly thereafter in a very very fun in a very very fun book, book, book, piece of writing, piece of writing, piece of art, piece of vibes called the piece of art, piece of vibes called the way of code by Rick Rubin. Now, ## [00:06:32 - 00:07:06] way of code by Rick Rubin. Now, this was inspired by the doubted ching this was inspired by the doubted ching that he kicks this thing off. I read that he kicks this thing off. I read this book 40 years ago this book 40 years ago and it changed my life forever and so and it changed my life forever and so the way of code is sort of getting its the way of code is sort of getting its get getting its vibes from the book of get getting its vibes from the book of the way. the way. Let's take a look. Uh this is this is I Let's take a look. Uh this is this is I think part of what's in our public think part of what's in our public consciousness about vibe coding. Uh ## [00:07:06 - 00:07:38] consciousness about vibe coding. Uh right, right or wrong, right, right or wrong, awesome or indifferent, however you feel awesome or indifferent, however you feel about it, this really did help set the about it, this really did help set the tone. What is this book? tone. When we recognize code as elegant, other When we recognize code as elegant, other code becomes sloppy. When we praise code becomes sloppy. When we praise efficiency, the notion of waste is born. efficiency, the notion of waste is born. We're getting into some deep opposites We're getting into some deep opposites here. Being and non-being create each here. Simple and complex, long and other. Simple and complex, long and short, high and low. Front end and back ## [00:07:38 - 00:08:09] short, high and low. Front end and back end. Let's go. Therefore, the vibe coder end. Therefore, the vibe coder builds without laboring instructs by builds without laboring instructs by quiet example. The work is done and then forgotten. That is why it lasts That is why it lasts forever. forever. So this book is filled with Dao inspired So this book is filled with Dao inspired vibes like this. ## [00:08:09 - 00:08:40] vibes like this. At the end, At the end, Rick reminds us this is how art creation Rick reminds us this is how art creation always happens. Starts with a prompt, a always happens. Starts with a prompt, a seed. seed. And we saw thereafter, And we saw thereafter, you know, Rick's going around, he's you know, Rick's going around, he's dropping this. He is the meme, right? 15 dropping this. 15 rules of vibe coding. Enjoy the process. Just vibe. But also, there's details Just vibe. But also, there's details that matter to us as developers. Use that matter to us as developers. Use agent mode. Copy errors and paste into ## [00:08:40 - 00:09:12] agent mode. Copy errors and paste into composer agent. Don't forget you can composer agent. Don't forget you can restore the previous composer chat. restore the previous composer chat. As it started to gain steam, we started As it started to gain steam, we started to hear more from to hear more from leading leading leading people in the engineering sphere, not people in the engineering sphere, not just in the art and creativity sphere just in the art and creativity sphere like Rick. This is from Simon Wilson. He like Rick. He wrote a wrote a wrote a kind of important web blog here on March kind of important web blog here on March 19th. I'm concerned that the definition 19th. I'm concerned that the definition is already escaping its original intent. ## [00:09:12 - 00:09:42] is already escaping its original intent. He says, He says, He says, "Vibe coding is not the same thing as "Vibe coding is not the same thing as writing code with the help of LLMs. writing code with the help of LLMs. I'm seeing people apply the term vibe I'm seeing people apply the term vibe coding to all forms of code written with coding to all forms of code written with the assistance of AI. I think that both the assistance of AI. I think that both dilutes the term and gives a false dilutes the term and gives a false impression of what's possible with impression of what's possible with responsible AI assisted programming." He responsible AI assisted programming." He outlines when it's okay. If the projects outlines when it's okay. If the projects are very very low stakes, if you've done ## [00:09:42 - 00:10:13] are very very low stakes, if you've done your considerations of security, of not your considerations of security, of not leaking your API keys, of keeping users leaking your API keys, of keeping users data private, being a good network data private, being a good network citizen, and really making sure you're citizen, and really making sure you're not not not literally letting people attack not just literally letting people attack not just your app, but your cash like Leo here. your app, but your cash like Leo here. Ever since I started sharing how I built Ever since I started sharing how I built my SAS using cursor, random things are ## [00:10:13 - 00:10:43] my SAS using cursor, random things are happening like maxed out usage on my API happening like maxed out usage on my API keys and much more. There's a lot of keys and much more. There's a lot of this stuff happening at the time this stuff happening at the time and probably still happening today. and probably still happening today. You know, Simon also pointed out that You know, Simon also pointed out that there were these two book publishers a there were these two book publishers a couple months later he points this out couple months later he points this out that produced vibe coding texts. And as that produced vibe coding texts. And as he says, they fail spectacularly to he says, they fail spectacularly to understand what the term vibe coding ## [00:10:43 - 00:11:14] understand what the term vibe coding means. They fail spectacularly to help means. They fail spectacularly to help him understand what they mean by the him understand what they mean by the term vibe coding. Now, Simon, if you don't know, he's the kind of guy that gets invited to check kind of guy that gets invited to check out GPT-4o first. And so, you know, he's out GPT-4o first. And so, you know, he's he's kind of he's been in the game a he's kind of he's been in the game a long time and he continues to be a long time and he continues to be a thought leader in the sphere. He's kind thought leader in the sphere. He's kind of pushing for this AI assist, this AI of pushing for this AI assist, this AI assisted development. And this is this assisted development. And this is this is something we've talked about a lot on is something we've talked about a lot on this channel ## [00:11:14 - 00:11:45] this channel that a vibe coder is not going to take that a vibe coder is not going to take your job, but an AI assisted developer your job, but an AI assisted developer probably will. probably will. And we've talked about the process of AI And we've talked about the process of AI assisted development assisted development before as well. You know, we want to we before as well. You know, we want to we want to really set ourselves up for want to really set ourselves up for success. If we're using a tool that's success. If we're using a tool that's going to help us with vibe coding, we going to help us with vibe coding, we want to make sure that we have connected want to make sure that we have connected the sort of important documentation that ## [00:11:45 - 00:12:14] the sort of important documentation that our coding agent will need. We want to our coding agent will need. We want to make sure we set up specific rules that make sure we set up specific rules that are associated with our workflows and are associated with our workflows and the way we do things. We want to the way we do things. We want to understand what we're building and why. Want to set out a plan to do that. We want to do testing. We want to do code want to do testing. We want to do code review and importantly we want to review and importantly we want to understand what the heck is going on. We understand what the heck is going on. We want to be able to read the code want to be able to read the code ourselves and really have that human ourselves and really have that human expertise. ## [00:12:17 - 00:12:48] And of course when we think about tooling for this cursor is the number tooling for this cursor is the number one thing that comes to mind. The AI one thing that comes to mind. The AI code editor built to make you code editor built to make you extraordinarily productive. The best way extraordinarily productive. The best way to code with AI. Now is it for all to code with AI. Now is it for all circumstances? I think that's part of circumstances? I think that's part of the point today the point today is that we need to be asking questions is that we need to be asking questions like this. This is from January. Our like this. Our approach is to build the engineer of the approach is to build the engineer of the future, a human AI programmer an order future, a human AI programmer an order of magnitude more effective than any one of magnitude more effective than any one programmer. Cursor today is the very ## [00:12:48 - 00:13:21] programmer. Cursor today is the very start of that. That was eight months start of that. That was eight months ago. So they have continued to increase ago. So they have continued to increase their capabilities and move towards their capabilities and move towards their longerterm ambitions including their longerterm ambitions including this entirely new form of programming this entirely new form of programming where invention is effortless. It is where invention is effortless. It is already used by many more programmers already used by many more programmers than the millions that were using it in than the millions that were using it in January. But cursor is not the only dog January. But cursor is not the only dog in town. We also see other AI enabled in town. We also see other AI enabled coding agents even these fully ## [00:13:21 - 00:13:54] coding agents even these fully autonomous software engineers and the autonomous software engineers and the lines are starting to blur more and lines are starting to blur more and more. Devon the AI software engineer more. Devon the AI software engineer from Cognition AI will help you crush from Cognition AI will help you crush your backlog with your own personal AI your backlog with your own personal AI engineering team. Is it an engineer or engineering team. is it an engineering team? This is from September this month. Cognition raised a ton of cash, over Cognition raised a ton of cash, over $400 million to build the future of $400 million to build the future of software engineering. And in that press software engineering. And in that press release, they sort of told us last March ## [00:13:54 - 00:14:24] release, they sort of told us last March when we launched Devon, it wasn't clear when we launched Devon, it wasn't clear that this future would ever become a that this future would ever become a reality. reality. Today, Today, Today, it's clearer. it's clearer. Agents are already doing real work Agents are already doing real work alongside individual developers within alongside individual developers within large enterprise engineering teams. As with many technologies throughout history, what first seemed a fringe history, what first seemed a fringe theory quickly became an obvious theory quickly became an obvious reality. And of course, of course, the reality. And of course, of course, the cursor the cognition team acquired ## [00:14:24 - 00:14:54] cursor the cognition team acquired famously wind surf famously wind surf doubling their annual recurring revenue doubling their annual recurring revenue in a crazy move where they didn't really in a crazy move where they didn't really acquire the leadership but they acquired acquire the leadership but they acquired the entire body of engineers. the entire body of engineers. Now, interestingly, if we consider Now, interestingly, if we consider Windsurf, Windsurf, Windsurf, their wave inspired logo, the form in their wave inspired logo, the form in the logo, they told us it's more than the logo, they told us it's more than just a shape. It's a feeling. It echoes ## [00:14:54 - 00:15:25] just a shape. It's a feeling. It echoes how ideas move when there's no friction, how ideas move when there's no friction, fluid and forward, very vibes focused. fluid and forward, very vibes focused. Wind surf was. And we continue to see Wind surf was. And we continue to see progress from tools like clawed code progress from tools like clawed code that more and more people are talking that more and more people are talking about all the time certainly in in our about all the time certainly in in our circles at a maker space and codeex circles at a maker space and codeex which seems to be shipping like a bunch which seems to be shipping like a bunch of legends. The Codex team of course uh of legends. The Codex team of course uh Codex is hard to follow. We've talked Codex is hard to follow. We've talked about Codex on this channel before. Uh ## [00:15:25 - 00:15:55] about Codex on this channel before. Uh Codex is generally Codex is generally the brand at OpenAI for agentic coding. the brand at OpenAI for agentic coding. And so you want to think about And so you want to think about codeex as this kind of agent that can codeex as this kind of agent that can kind of do its own work in its own kind of do its own work in its own computer and it can also be able to meet computer and it can also be able to meet you in any of the tools you use wherever you in any of the tools you use wherever you work. you work. So it starts to become like what exactly ## [00:15:56 - 00:16:27] So it starts to become like what exactly is AI assisted development? Where does is AI assisted development? Where does vibe coding fit in? We've talked about vibe coding fit in? We've talked about agents on this channel a lot. agents on this channel a lot. And we like to talk about these as And we like to talk about these as systems that can leverage or emulate systems that can leverage or emulate reasoning to make dynamic decisions in reasoning to make dynamic decisions in an application flow. Uh famously last an application flow. Uh famously last week week week known about town known about town Simon said I think agent may finally Simon said I think agent may finally have a widely agreed enough upon have a widely agreed enough upon definition to be useful. Now, ## [00:16:27 - 00:16:58] definition to be useful. Now, an LLM agent that runs tools in a loop an LLM agent that runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal, to achieve a goal, as whiz reminds us, we've got another as whiz reminds us, we've got another agents or loop writing tool using LLM's agents or loop writing tool using LLM's definition to work with here. So, a lot definition to work with here. So, a lot of people are are looking at this. They're thinking about this. If we return to Simon's vibe coding return to Simon's vibe coding web blog from March, it's kind of web blog from March, it's kind of interesting. interesting. He reminds us that using LMS for code ## [00:16:58 - 00:17:29] He reminds us that using LMS for code responsibly is not vibe coding. The job responsibly is not vibe coding. The job of a software developer is not just to of a software developer is not just to turn out code and features. We need code turn out code and features. We need code that demonstrabably works, can be that demonstrabably works, can be understood by other humans and machines, understood by other humans and machines, and will support continued development. and will support continued development. We also need to read the code. His golden rule for production quality AI golden rule for production quality AI assisted programming is that he won't assisted programming is that he won't commit any code to his repo if he commit any code to his repo if he couldn't explain exactly what it does to couldn't explain exactly what it does to somebody else. This is a great ## [00:17:29 - 00:17:59] somebody else. This is a great interesting line here. If an LLM wrote interesting line here. If an LLM wrote the code for you and then reviewed it, the code for you and then reviewed it, tested it thoroughly and made sure you tested it thoroughly and made sure you could explain how it works to someone could explain how it works to someone else that's not vibe coding and made else that's not vibe coding and made sure you could explain it's software sure you could explain it's software development. development. the usage of an LM to support that the usage of an LM to support that activity is immaterial. activity is immaterial. Now, we've covered codecs and autonomous Now, we've covered codecs and autonomous software engineers on this channel software engineers on this channel before, and you know, when when you sort before, and you know, when when you sort of look and see how you're supposed to ## [00:17:59 - 00:18:31] of look and see how you're supposed to use one of these autonomous software use one of these autonomous software engineers, you sort of submit the engineers, you sort of submit the description of what you want it to do description of what you want it to do while it runs, it's going to do a bunch while it runs, it's going to do a bunch of stuff, and then you should be of stuff, and then you should be reviewing the output. we're sort of, you reviewing the output. we're sort of, you know, the sort of helping you know, the sort of helping you understand so you could explain what it understand so you could explain what it does to other people in the future. does to other people in the future. Maybe that's part of the AI assist. So we can sort of extend this idea of an we can sort of extend this idea of an agent to this idea of a coding agent. agent to this idea of a coding agent. And this is important because although ## [00:18:31 - 00:19:04] And this is important because although we can use them to vibe, I think what's we can use them to vibe, I think what's more useful to think about is we should more useful to think about is we should be using them. Yes, they're leveraging be using them. Yes, they're leveraging reasoning to make dynamic decisions in reasoning to make dynamic decisions in an application flow, but that an application flow, but that application flow is designed to produce application flow is designed to produce working and functional, potentially even working and functional, potentially even production level code. And there's production level code. And there's different levels of producing code. different levels of producing code. There's different levels of agency that There's different levels of agency that we might have over it from fully manual we might have over it from fully manual to searching you know the kind of level to searching you know the kind of level two the stack overflow search to ## [00:19:04 - 00:19:36] two the stack overflow search to using co-pilot using co-pilot to just literally leveraging ChatGPT to just literally leveraging ChatGPT and we've and we've and we've kind of started to get into this kind of started to get into this interesting space now last time we interesting space now last time we talked about this we had cursor and talked about this we had cursor and windurf here and as we've mentioned windurf here and as we've mentioned already Devon has acquired wind surf. already Devon has acquired wind surf. So, uh, we've also added another layer So, uh, we've also added another layer of CLI because cursor is now not just of CLI because cursor is now not just leveraging other people's CLI tools. leveraging other people's CLI tools. Cursor has built in their own CLI tool. So, we start to see kind of unification ## [00:19:36 - 00:20:08] So, we start to see kind of unification of coding agency at each level of the of coding agency at each level of the code code code help stack. Where are the vibes? Where is AI assist? And by the way, And by the way, we also talked about this idea of teams, we also talked about this idea of teams, this AI teams piece. Devon is being sold this AI teams piece. Devon is being sold as an entire team now, not just a as an entire team now, not just a software engineer. ## [00:20:08 - 00:20:38] software engineer. So, you know, it's worth asking like how So, you know, it's worth asking like how far away from you, how far away are you far away from you, how far away are you from the actual work being done, the from the actual work being done, the actual scoping, planning, reasoning, actual scoping, planning, reasoning, coding, explaining what the code does. coding, explaining what the code does. So, Whiz, let's have a little discussion So, Whiz, let's have a little discussion here about AI assist and vibe here about AI assist and vibe coding. Uh, first of all, are they the coding. Uh, first of all, are they the same? And if not, where's the line? same? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, they're definitely not the &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, they're definitely not the same. So, one of the things I would ## [00:20:38 - 00:21:10] same. So, one of the things I would implore people to think about is vibe implore people to think about is vibe coding should be something that is do I coding should be something that is do I mean Simon Wilson's point is always mean Simon Wilson's point is always great. Carpathy's original definition of great. Carpathy's original definition of vibe coding was great. Uh all of these vibe coding was great. Uh all of these things were great which is that it's for things were great which is that it's for like like like your mom. your mom. uh you know uh that that's what it is uh you know uh that that's what it is like it's for people who don't like it's for people who don't uh who don't uh who don't kind of you know actually ## [00:21:10 - 00:21:41] kind of you know actually uh do this stuff full-time I guess is uh do this stuff full-time I guess is what I would say what I would say &gt;&gt; that that is the the big the crux &gt;&gt; that that is the the big the crux right vibe coding is for like anybody it right vibe coding is for like anybody it it's for it's you just type into the it's for it's you just type into the machine and the machine does stuff you machine and the machine does stuff you know and so That's the that's the idea. know and so That's the that's the idea. Now, AI assisted development is like Now, AI assisted development is like you're a developer you're a developer &gt;&gt; and you're using AI to assist you, &gt;&gt; and you're using AI to assist you, &gt;&gt; right? You should know it should not be &gt;&gt; right? You should know it should not be globally accessible, right? Like to to S globally accessible, right? Like to to S Wilson's point, like it should not ## [00:21:41 - 00:22:11] Wilson's point, like it should not require that you understand code. You require that you understand code. You should be able to type in the magic box should be able to type in the magic box and then get an app out, right? Like and then get an app out, right? Like that's vibe coding. Uh AI system that's vibe coding. Uh AI system development is uh you have an awareness development is uh you have an awareness of the system you want to create. you of the system you want to create. you understand the technology, you're using understand the technology, you're using AI to augment you, right? You're using AI to augment you, right? You're using it to take you to the next level so that it to take you to the next level so that you have to write less boilerplate or you have to write less boilerplate or you have to write less, you know, lines you have to write less, you know, lines of code about XY Z or, you know, all of of code about XY Z or, you know, all of these other things like that's the idea ## [00:22:11 - 00:22:43] these other things like that's the idea of AI assisted development where you're of AI assisted development where you're in the driver's seat in the driver's seat with respect to code. FIB coding is that with respect to code. FIB coding is that you are not in the driver's seat with you are not in the driver's seat with respect to code. You're only in the respect to code. You're only in the driver's seat with respect to idea, driver's seat with respect to idea, right? Everything else is who cares. right? &gt;&gt; I'm almost getting this you're driving &gt;&gt; I'm almost getting this you're driving in the robo taxi versus driving your own in the robo taxi versus driving your own car kind of thing, you know? Like it's car kind of thing, you know? Like it's it's like you're being whisked away it's like you're being whisked away versus you have real actual agency over versus you have real actual agency over the way things are changing and ## [00:22:43 - 00:23:13] the way things are changing and unfolding in front of you. So unfolding in front of you. So if if we think about kind of this if if we think about kind of this maturity of the AI industry, we think maturity of the AI industry, we think about the maturity of especially the AI about the maturity of especially the AI engineering role and we think about this engineering role and we think about this kind of transition whe whether it's kind of transition whe whether it's whether it's somebody who's already a whether it's somebody who's already a developer or somebody who wants to developer or somebody who wants to become a developer, they're going to become a developer, they're going to have to kind of make their own have to kind of make their own transition from transition from either starting to understand vibe ## [00:23:13 - 00:23:44] either starting to understand vibe coding and then integrating it into coding and then integrating it into their current workflow and stack because their current workflow and stack because because vibe coding seems like it's at because vibe coding seems like it's at least a part of becoming an AI assisted least a part of becoming an AI assisted developer or you're going to have to developer or you're going to have to start from zero in which case you're start from zero in which case you're basically like like your mom right now basically like like your mom right now and you have to start somewhere and and you have to start somewhere and so you're going to start with vibe so you're going to start with vibe coding but then you've got to learn how coding but then you've got to learn how to become a developer through that lens. to become a developer through that lens. So I mean what what are you seeing ## [00:23:44 - 00:24:17] So I mean what what are you seeing in terms of this transition that the in terms of this transition that the industry is making and that you would industry is making and that you would encourage individuals to make from vibe encourage individuals to make from vibe coding to AI assist development. Maybe coding to AI assist development. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about your you can tell us a little bit about your journey into incorporating vibe coding. journey into incorporating vibe coding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh so so I don't I don't vibe code &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh so so I don't I don't vibe code these days except for like events like these days except for like events like this or uh or you know uh you know in this or uh or you know uh you know in class where like we're trying to teach class where like we're trying to teach people how to vibe code, right? Like people how to vibe code, right? Like there's no for me vibe coding is is uh ## [00:24:17 - 00:24:48] there's no for me vibe coding is is uh not useful at all if you're a software not useful at all if you're a software developer, if you have development uh developer, if you have development uh background. uh you know if you don't background. uh you know if you don't it's the best it's the best thing in the it's the best it's the best thing in the world right because now you could code world right because now you could code it's so cool you can make apps just by it's so cool you can make apps just by typing in the box I mean hell yeah uh typing in the box I mean hell yeah uh but the transition is you have to be but the transition is you have to be more thoughtful right you have to set up more thoughtful right you have to set up you have to think like a senior engineer you have to think like a senior engineer when you're producing your uh your your when you're producing your uh your your scaffolding your initial kind of scaffolding your initial kind of components you have to think about you ## [00:24:48 - 00:25:21] components you have to think about you know how AI is going to interpret your know how AI is going to interpret your intent right intent driven development intent right intent driven development you have to set up the background. So you have to set up the background. So your agents. mmd files, you have to pause your agents. mmd files, you have to pause at every single diff and only use AI to at every single diff and only use AI to add very focused, very small features add very focused, very small features and to encourage it to use best practice and to encourage it to use best practice development and to encourage it to write development and to encourage it to write tests and to encou and on and on, right? tests and to encou and on and on, right? Like this is the idea is all of this Like this is the idea is all of this stuff that you would normally do instead stuff that you would normally do instead of just doing it like once or uh ## [00:25:21 - 00:25:51] of just doing it like once or uh entirely by yourself, you get AI to help entirely by yourself, you get AI to help you do it. You can do it a lot more. you do it. Like instead of writing two unit tests, Like instead of writing two unit tests, why not write all of them actually, why not write all of them actually, right? Something that everyone hates right? Something that everyone hates doing in practice, but now you can just doing in practice, but now you can just get your good friend who never complains get your good friend who never complains AI to help do this for you, right? Uh AI to help do this for you, right? Uh like this is the idea. You have to look like this is the idea. You have to look at all the tools you have access to and at all the tools you have access to and fully leverage them, not just fully leverage them, not just &gt;&gt; the code generation. &gt;&gt; the code generation. &gt;&gt; Sticking with that point. Okay. Then if if we say vibe coding is not really ## [00:25:52 - 00:26:22] if we say vibe coding is not really necessary but but AI assist is and we we necessary but but AI assist is and we we consider this this this this consider this this this this wide range of potential AI assist tools wide range of potential AI assist tools that we have access to. that we have access to. How do we select the right tool for us? You know is it just cursor? You know if You know is it just cursor? You know if I'm more advanced do I use a CLI tool? If I'm less advanced do I use an If I'm less advanced do I use an autonomous software engineer? Um, how autonomous software engineer? Um, how how are you using these in your daily ## [00:26:22 - 00:26:53] how are you using these in your daily workflows? Are you just using GitHub workflows? Are you just using GitHub Copilot because that's all you're Copilot because that's all you're allowed to do at work? I mean I mean h allowed to do at work? I mean I mean h how can people kind of choose the right how can people kind of choose the right tool for the job when it comes to AI tool for the job when it comes to AI assist? assist? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this is this is this is &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this is this is this is like the bajillion dollar question, like the bajillion dollar question, right? Uh for me all I can do is talk right? Uh for me all I can do is talk about what I do. uh for me uh you know I about what I do. uh for me uh you know I I I have a workplace that permits the I I have a workplace that permits the use of AI assisted development and so use of AI assisted development and so I'm lucky in that regard so I have I'm lucky in that regard so I have access to cloud code uh and so I use ## [00:26:53 - 00:27:25] access to cloud code uh and so I use cloud code that's my that's my favorite cloud code that's my that's my favorite AI assisted development tool uh in class AI assisted development tool uh in class so when we run the boot camps we use so when we run the boot camps we use cursor is it's very very you can see the cursor is it's very very you can see the code changes in the same window right code changes in the same window right you're not just in the CLI you're you're not just in the CLI you're you know, taken out of your normal flow. you know, taken out of your normal flow. It's like one box that does it all, It's like one box that does it all, right? Uh and I like cursor. I mean, right? I mean, it's a good tool. Uh it is it is it's a good tool. Uh it is it is proficient at the job. Uh you know, at proficient at the job. Uh you know, at the workplace though, uh claude code. Uh ## [00:27:25 - 00:27:57] the workplace though, uh claude code. Uh &gt;&gt; and we've heard from learners like they &gt;&gt; and we've heard from learners like they love cursor too. Oh yeah. Right. And so love cursor too. And so &gt;&gt; command K, right? You can just ask &gt;&gt; command K, right? You can just ask questions about whatever you're looking questions about whatever you're looking at, you know, command L, you can just at, you know, command L, you can just type with the agent, right? You can spin type with the agent, right? You can spin up these background agents. you all of this stuff right from your IDE, right, this stuff right from your IDE, right, which is something that people are used which is something that people are used to using. I I would say that, you know, to using. I I would say that, you know, when it comes to when it comes to using these tools, uh it's kind of like using these tools, uh it's kind of like the classic. If you're already deep the classic. If you're already deep into development, ## [00:27:57 - 00:28:28] into development, maybe you'll like something like Cloud maybe you'll like something like Cloud Code or Codeex, right? Code or Codeex, right? &gt;&gt; If you're not, if you're getting into &gt;&gt; If you're not, if you're getting into it, if you're if you're beginning your it, if you're if you're beginning your journey, Cursor is going to feel better. journey, Cursor is going to feel better. It's going to feel closer to what you It's going to feel closer to what you might expect and it's going to let you might expect and it's going to let you really uh be in the same environment as really uh be in the same environment as your as your code in a in a visual way, your as your code in a in a visual way, right? Not just like a logic. right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. If we even go up levels from that &gt;&gt; Yeah. If we even go up levels from that though, if we even go up to the though, if we even go up to the autonomous software engineer level and autonomous software engineer level and then up to even maybe a lower even lower then up to even maybe a lower even lower code level than that, right, as we're as ## [00:28:28 - 00:28:59] code level than that, right, as we're as we're sort of getting started. I mean, I we're sort of getting started. I mean, I think you've got a little bit to show us think you've got a little bit to show us on on the demo for even lower code on on the demo for even lower code possibilities here. Yes. But like when possibilities here. But like when when do I pick up a Devon? when do I pick up a Devon? &gt;&gt; I mean &gt;&gt; I mean &gt;&gt; I you know what I don't know. I I &gt;&gt; I you know what I don't know. I I haven't found use for Devon yet. I know loads of people are using Devon. Uh loads of people u like awes are are paying dollars for it. I think if I'm on a I could imagine using it if ## [00:29:00 - 00:29:30] if I'm on a I could imagine using it if I were starting a company today and I I were starting a company today and I did not have access to developers, did not have access to developers, &gt;&gt; right? If or if my or if I myself was &gt;&gt; right? If or if my or if I myself was not a developer, I could figure not a developer, I could figure Devon. Devon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I Devon, &gt;&gt; Yeah. I Devon, &gt;&gt; I need seven I need seven devs. I got zero uh Devon, you know, like but but zero uh Devon, you know, like but but other than that, I I don't see it. Uh, other than that, I I don't see it. Uh, you know, I I I'm I'm a firm believer in ## [00:29:30 - 00:30:00] you know, I I I'm I'm a firm believer in AI system development. Devon feels a lot AI system development. Devon feels a lot more like a suite, right? This is a team more like a suite, right? This is a team member that you're that you're dealing member that you're that you're dealing with. This this guy is going to be your with. This this guy is going to be your programmer, right? programmer, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess the analogy is like when &gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess the analogy is like when do you replace a human with a robot, do you replace a human with a robot, right? Like literally in the right? Like literally in the manufacturing floor, right? It's it's manufacturing floor, right? It's it's like like probably you got to be doing probably you got to be doing a lot of volume and you got to have your a lot of volume and you got to have your processes super dialed for that robot to ## [00:30:00 - 00:30:31] processes super dialed for that robot to be working all the time. Uh otherwise be working all the time. Uh otherwise like is it really worth the like is it really worth the investment? If it's super low investment? If it's super low investment, maybe try renting it for a investment, maybe try renting it for a couple of days or a month, see how it couple of days or a month, see how it goes. But um yeah, it's uh it's it's a goes. But um yeah, it's uh it's it's a very interesting space and I think we'll very interesting space and I think we'll leave it there for for right now. But um leave it there for for right now. But um it's basically cursor is a great it's basically cursor is a great starting point if you want to be a dev. starting point if you want to be a dev. CLI tools a little bit. If you're a CLI tools a little bit. If you're a little bit more advanced, maybe you ## [00:30:31 - 00:31:02] little bit more advanced, maybe you don't need the whole thing. Maybe you don't need the whole thing. Maybe you can get it maybe you can just stay kind can get it maybe you can just stay kind of compact. um in that space, of compact. um in that space, you know, you're probably leveraging at you know, you're probably leveraging at least some some version of VS Code least some some version of VS Code anyways. Um some level of autocomplete anyways. Um some level of autocomplete anyways, but really I I think this key anyways, but really I I think this key is like understand it's the same thing is like understand it's the same thing with writing anything, I guess, with with writing anything, I guess, with these AI tools. Can you understand what these AI tools. Can you understand what you wrote? Because if not, you probably you wrote? Because if not, you probably shouldn't be submitting it anywhere, ## [00:31:02 - 00:31:33] shouldn't be submitting it anywhere, including into including into PRs. So, all right, good stuff. Let's PRs. Let's get into the demo piece here. Time to introduce end to end. Let's build, ship, introduce end to end. Let's build, ship, and share ChatGPT today, guys. and share ChatGPT today, guys. We've looked at ChatGPT before. And from a front-end development from a front-end development perspective, this is a very simple perspective, this is a very simple app. app. Is it actually that simple to code up ## [00:31:33 - 00:32:04] Is it actually that simple to code up with even very very low code tools? Uh with even very very low code tools? Uh we'll find out. As we think about the we'll find out. As we think about the stack, we want to think about kind of stack, we want to think about kind of the role it has in AI engineering. the role it has in AI engineering. We want to build, deploy, operate, and We want to build, deploy, operate, and improve LLM apps in production. And so improve LLM apps in production. And so leveraging the LLM application stack, leveraging the LLM application stack, this is one way we can kind of visualize this is one way we can kind of visualize everything we've done so far in this everything we've done so far in this series. The stack is of course series. The stack is of course leveraging putting the right stuff in ## [00:32:04 - 00:32:35] leveraging putting the right stuff in context. This in context learning design pattern is what people are talking about when is what people are talking about when they're talking about doing context they're talking about doing context engineering. Whereas Dexory will remind engineering. Whereas Dexory will remind us, everything that makes agents good is us, everything that makes agents good is context engineering. And so what is what context engineering. And so what is what is the endto-end stack look like? Well, is the endto-end stack look like? Well, if we think about this overall ecosystem ## [00:32:35 - 00:33:08] ecosystem of tools, of tools, of tools, we can kind of build something very we can kind of build something very simple. And this is something that we simple. And this is something that we encourage everybody to start with with encourage everybody to start with with something called the AI engineer something called the AI engineer challenge. Can you build and host a challenge. Can you build and host a simple app that just wraps an LLM? You simple app that just wraps an LLM? You can leverage something like the OpenAI can leverage something like the OpenAI Python SDK and any OpenAI model to just Python SDK and any OpenAI model to just build this. Now, we in this series have build this. Now, we in this series have leveraged the Responses API from part leveraged the Responses API from part one. We've also built in agents with the ## [00:33:08 - 00:33:39] one. We've also built in agents with the Agents SDK. In any case, we're using Agents SDK. In any case, we're using OpenAI libraries to orchestrate in the OpenAI libraries to orchestrate in the middle. When we go to host the app, we middle. When we go to host the app, we can actually host our application can actually host our application on Versell. And it's kind of interesting on Versell. And it's kind of interesting that when we host, that when we host, we are going to choose to kind of we are going to choose to kind of leverage a fast API backend, but we leverage a fast API backend, but we don't really have to in general. ## [00:33:39 - 00:34:10] don't really have to in general. Versel is like a full hosting service Versel is like a full hosting service that they'll take care of that for you that they'll take care of that for you if you'd like, but as developers, we if you'd like, but as developers, we want to kind of be able to see what's want to kind of be able to see what's going on back there. We want to be able going on back there. We want to be able to kind of understand uh what's to kind of understand uh what's happening and Verscell is built by the happening and Verscell is built by the makers and creators of Nex. js and makers and creators of Nex. js and this is often a very easy way to this is often a very easy way to spin up through Vibes a great front end. spin up through Vibes a great front end. Of course, front-end development ## [00:34:10 - 00:34:42] Of course, front-end development is an art and science in and of itself. is an art and science in and of itself. We're talking about vibe coding for We're talking about vibe coding for frontends today because if you're a frontends today because if you're a front-end developer and you really want front-end developer and you really want to build out a front end that truly to build out a front end that truly scales in production, there's a lot more scales in production, there's a lot more depth there that kind of needs to go depth there that kind of needs to go beyond vibe coding and into proper beyond vibe coding and into proper front-end AI assisted development. front-end AI assisted development. That's beyond the scope of what we talk That's beyond the scope of what we talk about here. I want to connect this to about here. I want to connect this to other parts of the series though other parts of the series though literally by thinking about how we need ## [00:34:42 - 00:35:13] literally by thinking about how we need to connect this whole thing to the to connect this whole thing to the information that our users need. And information that our users need. And this is the idea that we covered in part this is the idea that we covered in part two of RAG where we're doing retrieval two of RAG where we're doing retrieval and then generation. And as we saw then and then generation. And as we saw then we can actually kind of not have to go we can actually kind of not have to go through this embedding model and vector through this embedding model and vector store process but rather we can replace store process but rather we can replace that directly with the Responses API. that directly with the Responses API. And in fact we don't really even need to ## [00:35:13 - 00:35:44] And in fact we don't really even need to build out anything other than just build out anything other than just giving giving giving our application the file we want it to our application the file we want it to put in context. And we we also saw that put in context. And we we also saw that we could take this even further and we we could take this even further and we could do retrieval with any number of could do retrieval with any number of MCP servers just by using simple MCP servers just by using simple connectors that kind of can be connectors that kind of can be visualized up here. Essentially bringing visualized up here. Essentially bringing in this contextual data. But we don't in this contextual data. But we don't have to chunk our data and run it have to chunk our data and run it through embedding models and put it in through embedding models and put it in vector DBs. we can kind of just use the ## [00:35:44 - 00:36:15] vector DBs. we can kind of just use the Responses API to kind of allow us to do Responses API to kind of allow us to do this retrieval this retrieval based on the user query and then based on the user query and then generation to potentially get really generation to potentially get really great outputs. great outputs. And so if we if we think about we can And so if we if we think about we can also then connect also then connect not just to files and our own personal not just to files and our own personal data but to other APIs to other data but to other APIs to other MCP servers to other tools, ## [00:36:16 - 00:36:47] MCP servers to other tools, tool calling, function calling, tool calling, function calling, toolboxes of of different access to toolboxes of of different access to different up-to-date data that is also different up-to-date data that is also covered by the Responses API. And this covered by the Responses API. And this is where we talked about connectors and is where we talked about connectors and MCP in part two as well. Now, MCP in part two as well. Now, when we put all this together, we when we put all this together, we essentially have a UI that starts to essentially have a UI that starts to become a little bit more robust. We want become a little bit more robust. We want to be able to add stuff like photos and to be able to add stuff like photos and files. Let's zoom in a little bit. ## [00:36:47 - 00:37:18] files. Let's zoom in a little bit. Photos and files here. Or we want to be Photos and files here. Or we want to be able to connect specific MCP servers able to connect specific MCP servers here or here for instance. And maybe we here or here for instance. And maybe we actually want to be able to do a gentic actually want to be able to do a gentic search, which we covered in part three, search, which we covered in part three, directly from the toolbar, or even do a directly from the toolbar, or even do a little bit deeper search with deep little bit deeper search with deep research tools. So before we get into research tools. So before we get into today's demo, today's demo, Whiz, I just want to have a quick ## [00:37:18 - 00:37:48] Whiz, I just want to have a quick discussion on a couple of points. discussion on a couple of points. First of all, how hard is it really to First of all, how hard is it really to develop like a Chad ChatGPT style front end? develop like a Chad ChatGPT style front end? Uh this is fully vibes. So presumably, Uh this is fully vibes. So presumably, you know, your mom or dad could do it. you know, your mom or dad could do it. &gt;&gt; Yes, your mom and dad could do it. Yeah, absolutely. Uh with some effort, but absolutely. Uh with some effort, but they could do it. they could do it. &gt;&gt; And then when it comes to deploying the &gt;&gt; And then when it comes to deploying the back end, is it also just as easy today back end, is it also just as easy today with AI assist and with tools like ## [00:37:48 - 00:38:19] with AI assist and with tools like Verscell that are out there? Verscell that are out there? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, I mean it's it's not tough. uh and these kind of zero code platforms uh and these kind of zero code platforms do it they do a job uh certainly so uh do it they do a job uh certainly so uh would I say it's like the best job would I say it's like the best job you know hey they they do a job it is it you know hey they they do a job it is it hard to deploy uh no of course one one hard to deploy uh no of course one one line one command deployment is a ## [00:38:19 - 00:38:49] line one command deployment is a standard standard standard &gt;&gt; deploy we've been talking about it for &gt;&gt; deploy we've been talking about it for years years years &gt;&gt; now it's pervasive &gt;&gt; now it's pervasive &gt;&gt; it's everywhere Okay. And when we think &gt;&gt; it's everywhere Okay. And when we think about front end and backend tooling, about front end and backend tooling, you know, you know, you know, you're going to show us a couple you're going to show us a couple different tools, but how how can we different tools, but how how can we think about choosing the right tool for think about choosing the right tool for the right job with the right level of the right job with the right level of autonomy, whether we're doing front end autonomy, whether we're doing front end or whether we're doing backend, uh or whether we're doing backend, uh whether we're doing, you know, if we're whether we're doing, you know, if we're doing a quick prototype, probably less ## [00:38:49 - 00:39:21] doing a quick prototype, probably less serious. we can go a long way with vibes serious. we can go a long way with vibes or with the low code tool, but if we or with the low code tool, but if we really want to put something into really want to put something into production, classically it's more production, classically it's more serious. Um, should we kind of just serious. Um, should we kind of just leverage that same kind of hierarchy of cursor maybe cloud code style later? or are maybe cloud code style later? or are there specific things that we should be there specific things that we should be looking into on the front end and the looking into on the front end and the back end beyond the AI assist tools back end beyond the AI assist tools themselves? ## [00:39:21 - 00:39:54] themselves? Uh I don't think so. I mean the the whole point of this right is that you whole point of this right is that you just need vibe coding. So what you just need vibe coding. So what you should focus on is the vibe coding should focus on is the vibe coding piece. everything else that you need if piece. everything else that you need if especially if you're using some of the especially if you're using some of the options we're going to show off are like options we're going to show off are like are like even less you know I mean it are like even less you know I mean it tells you what extra tools you need like tells you what extra tools you need like there's a button that comes up and it there's a button that comes up and it asks you to input information right so asks you to input information right so uh any any additional tooling is just ## [00:39:54 - 00:40:26] uh any any additional tooling is just going to be fully given to you going to be fully given to you yeah so I guess um you know food for yeah so I guess um you know food for thought for for everybody. It's like thought for for everybody. It's like it's like how do you really make sure it's like how do you really make sure that you're doing a job that is not that you're doing a job that is not going to be automated, right? If you're going to be automated, right? If you're a front-end dev, if you're a backend dev a front-end dev, if you're a backend dev today, like what should you be doing? today, like what should you be doing? Should you be, you know, just doing more Should you be, you know, just doing more volume of of tickets or, you know, ## [00:40:26 - 00:40:56] volume of of tickets or, you know, should you just be understanding the should you just be understanding the larger code base uh more holistically larger code base uh more holistically like like you know, to to Nathan's point in the you know, to to Nathan's point in the chat, it's like, okay, I can just have chat, it's like, okay, I can just have it explain the code to me in in two it explain the code to me in in two seconds. It's like, all right, that's seconds. So, uh, how is it that people can true. So, uh, how is it that people can create value as humans in in code today? create value as humans in in code today? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, this is an impossible question to this is an impossible question to answer, right? It's kind of food for answer, right? It's kind of food for thought for everybody. But thought for everybody. But &gt;&gt; yeah, ## [00:40:56 - 00:41:28] &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; but in in my impression, in my &gt;&gt; but in in my impression, in my uh in my my experience of life, uh the uh in my my experience of life, uh the world has never been about how fast can world has never been about how fast can you code uh or what number of lines of you code uh or what number of lines of code can you produce, right? Uh it's code can you produce, right? Uh it's always been about can you can you get to always been about can you can you get to solution the fastest? And I think that, solution the fastest? And I think that, you know, you know, AI is is really good at producing big ## [00:41:28 - 00:41:59] AI is is really good at producing big lines of f of of code. You know what I lines of f of of code. You know what I mean? Like that's what it does. uh but mean? uh but we are still the best way to get there we are still the best way to get there the fastest because we know things that the fastest because we know things that AI doesn't have in its context window AI doesn't have in its context window because we have livas of context windows because we have livas of context windows and until that changes right until and until that changes right until everything's in the context window all everything's in the context window all the time uh you know a a software the time uh you know a a software engineer's career worth of information engineer's career worth of information is in the in the models is in the in the models context right I I think they're just context right I I think they're just always going to be a little bit they're always going to be a little bit they're going to need us to nudge them a lot I ## [00:41:59 - 00:42:30] going to need us to nudge them a lot I mean it's it's it's the most excellent mean it's it's it's the most excellent question question question &gt;&gt; yeah Yeah, I mean I don't want to I got &gt;&gt; yeah Yeah, I mean I don't want to I got to get to the demo here. Everybody to get to the demo here. Everybody should think about it, right? If AI should think about it, right? If AI assist can do it, what the hell are you assist can do it, what the hell are you doing? Okay, with that, let's go ahead doing? Okay, with that, let's go ahead and get into the demo. Whiz vibe coding and get into the demo. Whiz vibe coding ChatGPT ChatGPT ChatGPT &gt;&gt; front to back. Let's go. Off to you. &gt;&gt; front to back. Okay, so we're going to start Let's go. Okay, so we're going to start by looking at the real actual factual by looking at the real actual factual ChatGPT. So, this is like the real one. ChatGPT. This is not the vibe coded chat gypy. This is the one that exists on their ## [00:42:30 - 00:43:02] This is the one that exists on their website. classic. It's got a lot of website. It's got a lot of buttons, right? You can do lots of buttons, right? You can do lots of stuff. You can you do all these things. stuff. We're going to focus on a very specific We're going to focus on a very specific subset of features for our demo today subset of features for our demo today because there's a lot going on that we because there's a lot going on that we haven't really talked about when it haven't really talked about when it comes to uh Responses API or how to comes to uh Responses API or how to build jad ChatGPT. But, you know, build jad ChatGPT. But, you know, adding files, okay, yeah, it makes adding files, okay, yeah, it makes sense. You know, you can add files or sense. Uh some kind of agent mode, whatever. Uh some kind of agent mode, some kind of deep research mode. Okay, some kind of deep research mode. Okay, that makes sense. connectors. Fine. So, ## [00:43:02 - 00:43:34] that makes sense. connectors. Fine. So, let's go to our chat jeopardy. So, our chat jeopardy looks like this. First of all, the first you'll notice is that uh all, the first you'll notice is that uh it doesn't look it doesn't look as it doesn't look it doesn't look as polished, right? Like, I mean, it uh it polished, right? Like, I mean, it uh it could use some work, but it's all vibed could use some work, but it's all vibed up. So, we can fix that with some vibes, up. So, we can fix that with some vibes, share some screenshots. It's got a deep share some screenshots. It's got a deep research button. So, we uh you know, we research button. Now, this is have this research button. Now, this is not deep research. You notice it says not deep research. You notice it says just research enabled. very important just research enabled. very important piece of information there. Uh and then piece of information there. Uh and then we have this little clippy emoji we can ## [00:43:34 - 00:44:05] we have this little clippy emoji we can click to add files to our uh to our click to add files to our uh to our session. And this is going to allow us session. And this is going to allow us to ask questions like who is the author, to ask questions like who is the author, you know, uh of this paper. you know, uh of this paper. And what this is going to do is it's And what this is going to do is it's actually going to use the Responses API actually going to use the Responses API RAG that we learned a you know last week RAG that we learned a you know last week or two weeks ago, sorry. and then it's or two weeks ago, sorry. and then it's going to answer the question. A few going to answer the question. A few things you'll notice, we're looking at things you'll notice, we're looking at some dots that don't move. Uh we're not some dots that don't move. Uh we're not seeing a streamed response, right? So, ## [00:44:05 - 00:44:36] seeing a streamed response, right? So, this is already we can start to imagine, this is already we can start to imagine, okay, we we know how how we can make okay, we we know how how we can make this better. We know how we can extend this better. We know how we can change this. this. There you go. Now, the good thing about There you go. Now, the good thing about this particular uh you know uh version this particular uh you know uh version is that uh it was done in cursor. So, we is that uh it was done in cursor. So, we know what the code looks like. We got to review every piece of code. We got to look at every single piece of code and look at every single piece of code and that uh makes us very happy. Now, uh that uh makes us very happy. Now, uh we're going to look at that code in just we're going to look at that code in just a minute. But for this moment, what ## [00:44:36 - 00:45:07] a minute. But for this moment, what we're going to do is we're going to see we're going to do is we're going to see what other tools do uh with the same what other tools do uh with the same kind of prompt. And so what we have here kind of prompt. And so what we have here is we have lovable. Lovable is basically is we have lovable. Lovable is basically a uh it's a you know it it can create a uh it's a you know it it can create this web application using the uh this web application using the uh prompts. So you can see here we have a prompts. So you can see here we have a chat history where we started with chat history where we started with create a chat GPD club with file uploads create a chat GPD club with file uploads and a simple deep research agent right and a simple deep research agent right and then and then just a bunch of stuff and then and then just a bunch of stuff happened. We vibed it up and we get to ## [00:45:07 - 00:45:37] happened. We vibed it up and we get to this absolutely glorious application this absolutely glorious application with new chat button. We have research with new chat button. We have research AI trends, upload docu, we got a writing AI trends, upload docu, we got a writing assistant. We can do research mode, assistant. We can do research mode, right? Look at all these toggles and right? We love that. Of course, file stuff. Of course, file uploads to talk to our documents. This uploads to talk to our documents. This is the idea, right? And that that took is the idea, right? And that that took absolutely no effort at all. We just absolutely no effort at all. We just said, "Hey, do it." And then it did it. said, "Hey, do it." We got this. Now, here's a great We got this. Now, here's a great question. Uh, hello. How are you? ## [00:45:38 - 00:46:08] question. Uh, hello. How are you? You does it work? No. Okay. So, that's You does it work? So, that's obviously uh that's obviously something obviously uh that's obviously something that we're going to need to spend some that we're going to need to spend some time vibing with, right, in order to get time vibing with, right, in order to get it to work. Now, I have asked it just uh it to work. Now, I have asked it just uh just to be sure. I have said uh it's just to be sure. I have said uh it's still not working and it still doesn't still not working and it still doesn't work despite it having fixed everything. work despite it having fixed everything. So, uh perhaps we're seeing where where So, uh perhaps we're seeing where where vibe coding could let us down a little vibe coding could let us down a little bit. And then we go to our ChatGPT bit. And then we go to our ChatGPT clone from Verscell V0. Now notice with clone from Verscell V0. Now notice with V vers Verscel VV V0 we get a very ## [00:46:08 - 00:46:39] V vers Verscel VV V0 we get a very similarish UI right a very it's very similarish UI right a very it's very ChatGPT I mean say what you want about ChatGPT I mean say what you want about whether or not it works it looks like whether or not it works it looks like ChatGPT something else that we have is ChatGPT something else that we have is this again deep research mode right so this again deep research mode right so we can toggle on deep research mode we we can toggle on deep research mode we have a research specialist and a data have a research specialist and a data analyst we have two different depths of analyst we have two different depths of research we can do quick and thorough research we can do quick and thorough very cool uh you know what it shows us very cool uh you know what it shows us what uh tools it has access to. Very what uh tools it has access to. Very cool. We can also upload files if we cool. We can also upload files if we wanted to do that. Uh, you know, ## [00:46:39 - 00:47:11] wanted to do that. Uh, you know, awesome. And it does allow us to chat. awesome. Hey there, you know, how how are you? And, uh, we we should get a response. Look at that. We get a response. So, that's good. And again, it's got these that's good. And again, it's got these new chats. We can click around in new new chats. Uh, this is all vibed up right chats. Uh, this is all vibed up right from Vzero. So, this is dope. But we from Vzero. But we don't really have line of sight to the don't really have line of sight to the code, right? We don't have the code, right? We don't have the direct ability to understand the code. direct ability to understand the code. Like we can toggle into these very Like we can toggle into these very verbose. ts ## [00:47:11 - 00:47:41] verbose. ts verbose. ts files, so TypeScript files, right? And files, so TypeScript files, right? And kind of have an understanding, but for kind of have an understanding, but for the most part, this is a a solution that the most part, this is a a solution that just we're going to chat with it until just we're going to chat with it until it works the way we want. Uh, and so it works the way we want. Uh, and so we're going to go to now, uh, cursor and we're going to go to now, uh, cursor and we're going to look at what we did to we're going to look at what we did to get to the app that in my humble opinion get to the app that in my humble opinion works the best in that it actually works the best in that it actually works, which is a which is an important works, which is a which is an important uh, you know, uh, thing to see. You'll uh, you know, uh, thing to see. You'll notice the same thing. We're just using ## [00:47:41 - 00:48:12] notice the same thing. We're just using agent mode, right? We're we're vibe agent mode, right? We're we're vibe coding it up. Uh, you know, this says coding it up. Uh, you know, this says uh, you know, uh, we just need research uh, you know, uh, we just need research and add photos and files, modify the and add photos and files, modify the back end. Uh, very cool. Okay. Uh, we back end. Uh, we have this chat history. We can look have this chat history. We can look through all of the changes that happened through all of the changes that happened and we can see kind of the everything and we can see kind of the everything that went on. This is great. Uh, that went on. Uh, however, most importantly, all we had to however, most importantly, all we had to do in order to get our working front do in order to get our working front end, right, with our uh, agent backend ## [00:48:12 - 00:48:43] end, right, with our uh, agent backend and the and the RAG connector from and the and the RAG connector from uh, Responses API, right? What we did is uh, Responses API, right? What we did is we can literally we can literally take the repo we already had which is take the repo we already had which is our OpenAI Responses API repo. This is our OpenAI Responses API repo. This is one we've been working out of and then I one we've been working out of and then I just added the uh AI engineer challenge just added the uh AI engineer challenge to it. I just literally dragged and to it. I just literally dragged and dropped all the files from the AI dropped all the files from the AI engineer challenge which are already set engineer challenge which are already set up to uh to produce a versell up to uh to produce a versell application right and then I I said hey ## [00:48:44 - 00:49:15] application right and then I I said hey make it work with the with Responses API make it work with the with Responses API and do the stuff that I want and it and do the stuff that I want and it did. So what we're going to do is we're did. So what we're going to do is we're going to ignore looking at front end. going to ignore looking at front end. This is 100% vibes. I'm not a front-end This is 100% vibes. I'm not a front-end dev. Uh you know we can look at one of dev. Uh you know we can look at one of these files and see oh yeah there's some these files and see oh yeah there's some there's some JavaScript here. You know there's some JavaScript here. You know what I mean? Not my not my expertise. what I mean? I'm just going to trust in the uh in the I'm just going to trust in the uh in the AI overlords for that one. But we can AI overlords for that one. But we can look at our app and we can see what it's look at our app and we can see what it's done in order to get us what we needed. done in order to get us what we needed. You'll notice it's done a lot. Okay. So, ## [00:49:15 - 00:49:46] You'll notice it's done a lot. Okay. So, there's a lot of stuff going on. Uh so, we're going to look at very quickly kind we're going to look at very quickly kind of, you know, how this happened. Number of, you know, how this happened. Number one, we're going to see that we have our one, we're going to see that we have our Agents SDK in. This is dope because we Agents SDK in. This is dope because we just did Agents SDK last week, right? We just did Agents SDK last week, right? We have some fast API app. We have some have some fast API app. We have some classic corors uh middleware stuff. You classic corors uh middleware stuff. You need that. Without it, you'll have a sad need that. We have our uploaded files metadata day. We have our uploaded files metadata and use uh user vector stores. We have and use uh user vector stores. We have our chat request base model. This is our chat request base model. This is looking pretty familiar, right? Like ## [00:49:46 - 00:50:17] looking pretty familiar, right? Like we've this is the kind of thing that was we've this is the kind of thing that was in the open SDK uh you know uh section in the open SDK uh you know uh section of this uh of this event. So there you of this uh of this event. So there you go. We have create file. You'll notice go. You'll notice that the create file is creating this that the create file is creating this file actually on OpenAI. So it's not file actually on OpenAI. So it's not using like some persistence via uh you using like some persistence via uh you know uh you know uh Postgress or know uh you know uh Postgress or something like that. It's like straight something like that. It's like straight up using the Responses API file creation up using the Responses API file creation right client. files uh create then we can ## [00:50:17 - 00:50:48] right client. files uh create then we can create a vector store using the same create a vector store using the same thing with our client. vector vector thing with our client. vector vector store is create. All we have to do is store is create. All we have to do is save our vector store ID in our user save our vector store ID in our user vector store so that we can reference it vector store so that we can reference it later when we're making a a change. Uh later when we're making a a change. Uh we can also add files to our vector we can also add files to our vector stores. Of course, we can chat, right? stores. We can perform research if it's We can perform research if it's requested. Uh very cool. We have this requested. We have this generate. You'll notice that generate. Very cool. You'll notice that this generate has access to our vector this generate has access to our vector stores. If we have a vector store, we're ## [00:50:48 - 00:51:18] stores. If we have a vector store, we're going to use the vector store. Very going to use the vector store. Very neat. The code goes on and on, but the neat. The code goes on and on, but the idea is that this is literally just an idea is that this is literally just an extension of the actual Responses API extension of the actual Responses API and the Agents SDK, right? That's what's and the Agents SDK, right? That's what's powering that's the backend, right, for powering that's the backend, right, for this application is those tools we've this application is those tools we've already learned. And the reason this is already learned. And the reason this is important is because that means that the important is because that means that the front end is just a wrapper for those front end is just a wrapper for those things, right? And so you can see ## [00:51:18 - 00:51:50] things, right? And so you can see already we've built up research, we've already we've built up research, we've built up RAG uh and we can just keep built up RAG uh and we can just keep adding right to the back end. We can add adding right to the back end. We can add new endpoints with new functionality. Uh right, as we move to a more robust uh right, as we move to a more robust uh solution, we can we can add things like solution, we can we can add things like OOTH, right? in order to get your Gmail OOTH, right? in order to get your Gmail and your calendar connectors through the and your calendar connectors through the OpenAI responses connectors patterns. OpenAI responses connectors patterns. All of this is just using exactly the All of this is just using exactly the code we use from these notebooks and ## [00:51:50 - 00:52:22] code we use from these notebooks and then wrapping a niceish then wrapping a niceish front end around it, you know, and front end around it, you know, and that's the idea. That's the whole thing. that's the idea. Uh, you know, we're going to go back to Uh, you know, we're going to go back to Greg uh to to to close out here. Before Greg uh to to to close out here. Before we do though, I gota I got to do the we do though, I gota I got to do the thing. Please uh you know like and thing. Please uh you know like and subscribe and ring the bell subscribe and ring the bell notification. We do these every single notification. We do these every single Wednesday, rain or shine. Uh and so Wednesday, rain or shine. Uh and so happy to do them. Uh and uh excited to happy to do them. Uh and uh excited to to keep diving into this. How do we to keep diving into this. How do we build chat gypy ourselves? How do we ## [00:52:22 - 00:52:53] build chat gypy ourselves? How do we eventually wind up with something, you eventually wind up with something, you know, reasonably performant? There you know, reasonably performant? There you go. All right. go. &gt;&gt; All right. Thanks, Whiz. And uh and if &gt;&gt; All right. And uh and if you do have a friend that you think you do have a friend that you think could benefit from this content, please could benefit from this content, please go ahead and send it their way if go ahead and send it their way if they're looking to build ChatGPT today. they're looking to build ChatGPT today. So Wiz, if I wanted to add like another So Wiz, if I wanted to add like another feature like we'll do certainly in the feature like we'll do certainly in the next part of this series, how hard is it next part of this series, how hard is it going to be to add that as a new going to be to add that as a new front-end feature? Pure Vibes. ## [00:52:53 - 00:53:24] front-end feature? Pure Vibes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Add this. &gt;&gt; Pure Vibes. So &gt;&gt; Easy. So &gt;&gt; the front end piece is pure vibes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's no I'm not a front-end &gt;&gt; there's no I'm not a front-end developer. I I don't know JavaScript or developer. I I don't know JavaScript or or React or spelt or whatever. I don't or React or spelt or whatever. I don't even know what Nex. js I think it's even know what Nex. js I think it's using, right? Uh not my forte. Not the using, right? Not the thing I care about. 100% only vibes. thing I care about. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And then in terms of AI &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then in terms of AI engineering roles, would you say that's engineering roles, would you say that's typical for them? You don't really need ## [00:53:24 - 00:53:54] typical for them? You don't really need to be a front-end dev to get an AI to be a front-end dev to get an AI engineer role. Uh 100%. Uh you know, engineer role. Uh you know, your company has front-end developers your company has front-end developers who are super good at their jobs. That's who are super good at their jobs. That's right. right. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that you can't be a &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that you can't be a front-end dev that upskills into AI and front-end dev that upskills into AI and have both skill. Hey, that's not that's have both skill. Hey, that's not that's not bad. Uh but the idea is that, you not bad. Uh but the idea is that, you know, if you're working at a company, know, if you're working at a company, it's got front-end devs. You front end it's got front-end devs. You front end hasn't really changed much. It's still hasn't really changed much. It's still front end. You still build dope looking front end. You still build dope looking performant applications. Uh the thing ## [00:53:54 - 00:54:25] performant applications. Uh the thing that's changed is how we wire up the that's changed is how we wire up the back end, right? that that sort of like back end, right? that that sort of like adaptive front end. Oh, you asked this adaptive front end. Oh, you asked this question. Let me make it this color. question. Yeah, like like that. I mean, hey, we're Yeah, like like that. I mean, hey, we're going towards a a wide going towards a a wide &gt;&gt; that's the cool stuff. &gt;&gt; that's the cool stuff. &gt;&gt; Incredible future. Uh but yeah, today &gt;&gt; Incredible future. Uh but yeah, today not a lot of jobs out there for that. not a lot of jobs out there for that. Okay, thanks Whiz. Uh let's go ahead and Okay, thanks Whiz. Uh let's go ahead and wrap up. I don't see any questions in wrap up. I don't see any questions in the chat, but if you guys have them, the chat, but if you guys have them, please uh feel free to ship them our please uh feel free to ship them our way. We hopefully gave you guys a good way. ## [00:54:25 - 00:54:56] overview today on vibe coding. So if this is your first on vibe coding. So if this is your first series with us, how to build ChatGPT, series with us, how to build ChatGPT, we hope that you understand now vibe we hope that you understand now vibe coding is not the same as AI assisted coding is not the same as AI assisted development. And really in 2025 and development. And really in 2025 and beyond, you have to want to be a beyond, you have to want to be a developer to be a developer. I think developer to be a developer. I think this is one of the things that we ran this is one of the things that we ran into with vibe coding is people thought into with vibe coding is people thought you could kind of just get away with it. you could kind of just get away with it. Well, actually, no, that's not true. That said, if you don't care about being That said, if you don't care about being a developer and you're just a product ## [00:54:56 - 00:55:28] a developer and you're just a product manager, you're an engineering leader, manager, you're an engineering leader, being able to vibe code something up is being able to vibe code something up is still a useful nice to have, but you're still a useful nice to have, but you're not going to get the depth by doing not going to get the depth by doing that. That's going to allow you to that. That's going to allow you to demand that high salary for being able demand that high salary for being able to code apps. Um, this is just the to code apps. Um, this is just the reality of where we are today. Vibe reality of where we are today. Vibe coding a front-end interface that's chat coding a front-end interface that's ChatGPT style. It's a relatively simple ChatGPT style. It's a relatively simple interface is actually trivial. And interface is actually trivial. And you'll notice though that depending on ## [00:55:28 - 00:55:59] you'll notice though that depending on which tool you use and how you use it, which tool you use and how you use it, you're going to get different sorts of you're going to get different sorts of results. results. And the line between vibe coding and AI And the line between vibe coding and AI assist is one we should all be assist is one we should all be considering as developers. Which tools considering as developers. Which tools are we picking up off the shelf to use? Which ones are we helping us to really Which ones are we helping us to really find that real value creation for our find that real value creation for our careers, for our companies? careers, for our companies? How do we go beyond not just vibes but How do we go beyond not just vibes but beyond AI assistphere ## [00:55:59 - 00:56:27] beyond AI assistphere as developers of stuff that you uniquely as developers of stuff that you uniquely as a human could do with all the stuff as a human could do with all the stuff in your lifetimes context window. Uh so in your lifetimes context window. Uh so with that, we uh want to go ahead and with that, we uh want to go ahead and thank you everybody for coming. I don't thank you everybody for coming. I don't still see any questions in the chat, so still see any questions in the chat, so we're going to go ahead and wrap now. we're going to go ahead and wrap now. Thanks everybody for joining us for Thanks everybody for joining us for another session at AI Maker Space. We another session at AI Maker Space. We are on a mission to build the world's are on a mission to build the world's leading community for people like you ## [00:56:30 - 00:57:00] who want to build, ship, and share production LLM applications, production LLM applications, not just low code stuff based on vibes. not just low code stuff based on vibes. If that's you, we'd love for you to join If that's you, we'd love for you to join our cool, competent community of our cool, competent community of practitioners from around the world. We practitioners from around the world. We almost have 3,000 people in the Discord. So, join in, start making connections So, join in, start making connections with other folks who are trying to get with other folks who are trying to get on the path or already on the path, on the path or already on the path, maybe a bit further down than you today. maybe a bit further down than you today. We'd love to see you in there. And if you're looking for a way to get started ## [00:57:00 - 00:57:32] you're looking for a way to get started heading down the path, we have a very heading down the path, we have a very special announcement. We have a brand special announcement. We have a brand new course that we've just launched. You new course that we've just launched. You can be one of the very first signups. It's called the AI engineer onramp. I will be teaching it with our upand will be teaching it with our upand cominging instructor Cat Cat GPT Gothorp cominging instructor Cat Cat GPT Gothorp PhD. She's going to be running it with PhD. This is going to be a me directly. This is going to be a fiveweek course that's going to allow fiveweek course that's going to allow people to get up to the point of being ## [00:57:32 - 00:58:04] people to get up to the point of being able to build ship and share their very able to build ship and share their very first end to end application. This is first end to end application. This is one of the key bottlenecks we've one of the key bottlenecks we've identified in people who think they want identified in people who think they want to get on the path and are not sure how to get on the path and are not sure how to start or who think they might want to to start or who think they might want to get on the path and definitely don't get on the path and definitely don't know how to start or people who need to know how to start or people who need to lead teams of coders and want some skin lead teams of coders and want some skin in the game. So if that's you, if you in the game. So if that's you, if you know somebody like that, please let them know somebody like that, please let them know about the brand new AI engineer know about the brand new AI engineer onramp kicks off October 20th. And with ## [00:58:04 - 00:58:34] onramp kicks off October 20th. And with that, thank you so much for joining us that, thank you so much for joining us for another weekly Wednesday live for another weekly Wednesday live session at AI Makerspace. We'll be back session at AI Makerspace. We'll be back next week talking about the next chapter next week talking about the next chapter in our how to build ChatGPT saga. I in our how to build ChatGPT saga. I believe the next one we're doing is on believe the next one we're doing is on thinking and reasoning. and we'll talk thinking and reasoning. and we'll talk about how to build that kind of about how to build that kind of capability in. Maybe we'll cover a few capability in. Maybe we'll cover a few different capabilities if that one feels different capabilities if that one feels a little bit too easy. Thanks again for a little bit too easy. Thanks again for joining us. We'll see you next week. ## [00:58:34 - 00:59:06] joining us. We'll see you next week. Until then, keep building, shipping, and Until then, keep building, shipping, and sharing, and we'll do the same. Have a sharing, and we'll do the same. Have a good week, guys. good week, guys. But Greg, how do they get started But Greg, how do they get started building shipping and sharing? Getting building shipping and sharing? Getting started is the hardest part like it was started is the hardest part like it was for you and for me. You can get started for you and for me. You can get started with the AI engineer challenge and you with the AI engineer challenge and you can share it in the build ship share can share it in the build ship share channel on Discord. Links in the channel on Discord. Links in the description. What if they want to description. What if they want to accelerate their ability? Well, we accelerate their ability? Well, we actually have a 10-week intensive boot actually have a 10-week intensive boot camp where you learn to build, ship, and ## [00:59:06 - 00:59:24] camp where you learn to build, ship, and share production ready LLM applications share production ready LLM applications every single week. The AI engineering every single week. The AI engineering boot camp cohort starting soon. We'll boot camp cohort starting soon. We'll have you building, shipping, and sharing have you building, shipping, and sharing like a legend in no time. We'll see you like a legend in no time. We'll see you in class.
